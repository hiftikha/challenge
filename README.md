## About this project
A simple Android app to learn more about the Rick and Morty television show.

### Rick and Morty API documentation
https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

### Project setup
The only setup needed is to open the project in Android Studio. No special project setup required.

### Time limit for project
Once the project is received, you should work on the project and send the project back within 24 hours of receiving. We suggest allotting two hours to tackle the initial crash and to add as many features as you’d like. You are NOT required to complete all features- the list below is simply a suggestion of what is possible and you are free to pick whatever features seem the most interesting to you. You are free to manage your time however you see fit!

### Submission
Once you are ready to submit your work, update this README with a description of what you have built and any instructions necessary to build and use the app. Zip it and send it back.

## Bugs and Features

### Initial crash
The app will crash at runtime when you launch the app on your emulator or device. Fix it! Hint: look at Logcat and consult the API documentation.

### Display episode details
When using the app, you will notice you can click on an episode to find more details about the episode. You will notice there are some issues though. Hint: look at how the episode is passed into the fragment.

### Filter characters for specific episode
You will notice when you browse characters for a specific episode… you receive characters for ALL episodes. Modify the app to only return characters relevant to the specific episode.

### Show character details in a new screen
Currently when you tap on a character, you won’t see actual character details, but simply a number in a pop-up instead. Build a new screen to show character details.

### Choose your own feature!
Anything is fair game. Paginated scroll, new UIs, adding your favorite 3rd party library, tests… whatever you think shows off your Android skills!
