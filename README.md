# Android-Interview-Challenge

## About this project
A simple Android app to learn more about the Rick and Morty television show.

### Rick and Morty API documentation
https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation

## Tasks: bugs and features

### Let's address the initial crash
The app will crash at runtime when you launch the app on your emulator or device. Fix it! Hint: look at Logcat and consult the API documentation.

### Add a feature #1: Display episode details
When using the app, you will notice you can click on an episode to find more details about the episode.
You will notice there are some issues though. 
* Hint: look at how the episode is passed into the fragment.

### Add a feature #2: Filter characters for specific episode
You will notice when you browse characters for a specific episode… you receive characters for ALL episodes. 
Modify the app to only return characters relevant to the specific episode.

### Add a feature #3: Show character details in a new screen
Currently when you tap on a character, you won’t see actual character details, but simply a number in a pop-up instead.
Build a new screen to show character details.

### Optional (Open Task): Choose your own feature!
Anything is fair game. Paginated scroll, new UIs, adding your favorite 3rd party library, tests… whatever you think shows off your Android skills!

## Additional Info
### Project setup
The only setup needed is to open the project in Android Studio. No special project setup required.
